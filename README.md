*personally, I would recommend that you move all the files to the game folder (create a modded folder there or something)

Open reimport.bat // Запустить файл reimport.bat

Choose northgard_res_pak.bms // В окне reimport.bat выбрать northgard_res_pak.bms

Choose res.pak in game folder // Потом выбрать res.pak в папке с игрой (steam/steamapps/common/northgard)

Choose data.cbd // Потом выбрать скачанный файл data.cbd

# Congratulation
